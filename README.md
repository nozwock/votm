It was developed to automate the laborious procedure of voting which happens once every year in schools (at least in my school) for some posts (for eg. let's say for selection of Student Council, Head-boy/girl, etc.), earlier this was used to be done through the ballot box system which used to take a lot of time and effort of the school staff to yield the results which would normally take weeks, contrary to what <i>VOTM</i> or automation can offer with ease. It also happens to be my first project to ever work on, so yaya! :octocat:

## üìö Usage

### üìÑ Voting

If you've downloaded the release binary:
- Run the `manage` app for configurations (such as Candidate Names, Tokens generation, etc).
- Now, you may run the `vote` app to start a voting session.

Or if you've gotten it directly from source:
- you can run `manage.py`, via:

    `python -m votm.manage` **or** `python manage.py`
- and `vote.py`, via:
    
    `python -m votm.vote` **or** `python vote.py`

|           |                                                                                                                       |
| --------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Note:** | 1. Default password is a blank field (i.e. ""). <br>2. Password/key are simply stored as sha256 hashes (not salted!). |

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration file
Configuration file is stored at these following paths-
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\nozwock\votm`
- Linux: `$HOME/.local/share/votm`


## üòï It Doesn't Work?
There are many possibilities on why it may not be working. You may not have the runtime requirements mentioned below installed (if you're doing it from source). Other than that some known reasons for issues you might've encountered might be:
- due to incompatibility between the dependencies & python version.
- due to incompatible version of python; This has been tested only on Python 3.7 & 3.10


## üèóÔ∏è Get it from Source

1. Clone the repository, and checkout to `./votm`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nozwock/votm.git
cd votm
```

### üìã Runtime Requirements

2. To setup a virtual environment, do:
```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate
```

**Note:** It's `venv/bin/activate` on Linux/MacOS

3. To install prerequisites, do:

```sh
pip install .
```

**Or** you could just use `poetry` instead via:

```sh
poetry install
```
